# AppDDashImageDrop

Chrome Extension to allow images to be dropped into the image widgets.
Sadly, it currently polls every 2 seconds to find the elements, which is not too efficient.

To Install: 
- Download a copy to a local directory
- In Chrome Extensions, select Developer Mode
- Load unpacked extension and choose the directory of the local copy
- Reload AppD tabs for the extension to take effect
